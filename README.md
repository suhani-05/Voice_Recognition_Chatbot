Voice Recognition Chatbot:
This project involves creating a simple voice recognition chatbot using Python. It listens to user inputs via a microphone and processes them using the speech_recognition library to convert speech to text. The chatbot then analyzes the input and responds accordingly using a text-to-speech engine (pyttsx3). The chatbot can respond to basic greetings and questions such as "Hello" or "How are you?". The program continues to listen and respond in real time until the user says "exit" to end the session. This project demonstrates the integration of voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities in Python, offering a simple interactive experience.
